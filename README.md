# Get-WhatsNew

[Get-WhatsNew][04] is a cmdlet that provides information about changes and new features for a
version of PowerShell, delivered to the local terminal experience.

## Motivation

Customers are unaware of benefits, new features and changes, that could impact their automation,
performance and security. Today, this useful information is provided through [Microsoft Docs][01]
and the PowerShell GitHub repository. PowerShell customers would benefit from being able to get this
information in the terminal as they expect.

- Customers expect to learn about available features that may enable new solutions
- Customers expect version specific information available from within PowerShell to make upgrade
  decisions.

> As an admin,
> I can list the new features released in my current version of PowerShell, similar to [webview][02]
> so that I can discover and implement new features in managing my products.

> As a developer,
> I can list the new features released in my current version of PowerShell, similar to [webview][02]
> so that I can discover and implement new features to develop automation solutions.
